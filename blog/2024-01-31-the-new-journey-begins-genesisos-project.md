Hola Amigos! It is time for New Year, New Name, New Beginnings. Yes we are a little late for that and apologies in advance for making everyone wait so long.

<!-- truncate -->
GenesisOS** is born out of the flames of the Burning Enthusiasm of the Successful **ProtonPlus**. While our main focus is on delivering a good experience both functionally and visually, we are aiming to be more than functionally minimalist and going beyond ordinary.

**GenesisOS** builds will start rolling out over upcoming weeks for all the devices on our current roster of Official Devices.

[Checkout Our Official Device Roster↗](https://www.genesisos.dev/devices)

Our source code is up and public. We invite everyone to build **GenesisOS** for their devices and apply for maintainership through our maintainership form.

[Apply For Maintainership↗](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO8yUMb9c_Ra--Ytj-wgOz-3g86p61B1PZX1j7YTIwiYm8FQ/viewform?pli=1)

We encourage everyone who wants to maintain **GenesisOS** officially to apply for maintainership as it helps us all grow. It's always good to welcome new members to our family and the more devices we have on our roster the better. We also encourage everyone to submit patches on our source code through pull requests.

Last but not the least thank you for your patience and we hope you enjoy your experience with **GenesisOS**.
